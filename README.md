## Hello there!

#### My name is Gabor Pfalzer, I am a Full-Stack web developer, based in London, UK.

[Check out my Porfolio here](https://pfalzer.dev)

Currently working on building futher projects to my Portfolil. I mainly work with React, Vue and Node.js, but also interested in PHP/Laravel. Using Javascript most of the time, slowly transitioning to TypeScript.

**Learning in progress**: TypeScript, TDD, GraphQL, Python, Linux

## Techstack:

### Languages

JavaScript | TypeScript | HTML | CSS | SQL | Python 


### Frontend

React | Redux | Vue.js | Next.js | Gatsby | Sass


### Backend

Node.js | Express | MySQL | PostgresSQL | MongoDB | GraphQL | JamStack


### Other Tools

Git | Jest | Docker | Figma


### Completed Projects:

- [Tradelog](https://tradelog-app.herokuapp.com/) - JavaScript | React | Redux | NodeJS | Express | PostgresSQL | Knex <br>
  Full stack application for tracking stock market trade results. Create accounts, strategies, track your P&L, success rate.
- [Rewards](https://gold-that-glitters.herokuapp.com/todos) - JavaScript | React | Context-api <br>
  A two-sided, glorified todo application. You earn coins by completing tasks, you can spend them on rewards you set up for yourself.
- [VTM- Diceroller](https://vtm-diceroll.netlify.app/) - TypeScript | React | Jest <br>
  My first React Application completed in Typescript. Diceroll generator for tabletop RPG, Vampire the Masquerade. Internal logic unit tested by Jest. 
- [Extendable Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://rock-paper-dlc.netlify.app/) - TypeScript | React | Jest <br>
  My first attempt to build an application fully with Test Driven Development, using React Testing Library and Jest. Evergreen junior classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer, extendable with the fantastic Day 1 DLC, Lizard-Spock. 

### Ongoing Projects:

- [Bookshelf](https://github.com/pfalzergbr/bookshelf) - TypeScript | Vue | Node.js | Express | TypeORM | GraphQL | Jest <br>
  Full stack application, my first attempt to crack TypeScript - GraphQL on the backend. Bookshelves are pretty, and nice to fill up with books, but reading them is even cooler. The app Lets the user build reading lists, and self-authorize buying more based on actual reading progress. 
- [Personal Blog](https://github.com/pfalzergbr/bookshelf) - Gatsby | GraphQL | Sanity.io  <br>
  My tech/status report blog in progress, practice picking up Gatsby and SSGs. All I need is a catchy name now.
