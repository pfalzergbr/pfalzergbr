## Hello there!

#### My name is Gabor Pfalzer, I am a Full-Stack web developer, based in London, UK.
#### Open to Tech Job offers, [Check out my Porfolio here](https://pfalzer.dev).


**Main project in the works**: [Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 - Character Management](https://dnd-legacy.netlify.app/)
TypeScript | React | GraphQL & TypeGraphQL | Apollo | NodeJs | MongoDB | TypeGoose
Massive full stack application for D&D game management, built in collaboration with an amazing UX Designer friend, under the name of StudioGR. 
In skeleton state, but the functionality is already interesting!
Check out the project on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/studiogr)


**Learning in progress**: TypeScript, Java. 

Learning Java at the moment, mainly to have access to more resources about computer science topics, Design Patterns, Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Completed Projects:

- [Rewards](https://gold-that-glitters.herokuapp.com/todos) - JavaScript | React | Context-api <br>
  A two-sided, glorified todo application. You earn coins by completing tasks, you can spend them on rewards you set up for yourself.
- [VTM- Diceroller](https://vtm-diceroll.netlify.app/) - TypeScript | React | Jest <br>
  My first React Application completed in Typescript. Diceroll generator for tabletop RPG, Vampire the Masquerade. Internal logic unit tested by Jest. 
- [Extendable Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://rock-paper-dlc.netlify.app/) - TypeScript | React | Jest <br>
  My first attempt to build an application fully with Test Driven Development, using React Testing Library and Jest. Evergreen junior classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against     the computer, extendable with the fantastic Day 1 DLC, Lizard-Spock. 

### Ongoing Projects:
- [Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 - Character Management](https://dnd-legacy.netlify.app/) - TypeScript | React | GraphQL & TypeGraphQL | Apollo | NodeJs | MongoDB | TypeGoose <br>
  Similar to the popular D&D Beyond, Full stack application for an older and more complex version of D&D. Collaboration with a UX designer friend, Reka Kertesz. The application   will let users create and manage D&D Characters, and provide utilities to use during tabletop (or more likely recenly - Discord) sessions. My largest project till date, and my   first collaborative work. 

- [Personal Blog](https://github.com/pfalzergbr/personal-blog) - Gatsby | GraphQL | Sanity.io  <br>
  My tech/status report blog in progress, practice picking up Gatsby and SSGs. All I need is a catchy name now. 

### Projects on Hold: 
- [Bookshelf](https://github.com/pfalzergbr/bookshelf) - TypeScript | Vue | Node.js | Express | TypeORM | GraphQL | Apollo | Jest | Vue Testing Library <br>
  Full stack application, my first attempt to crack TypeScript - GraphQL on the backend. Bookshelves are pretty, and nice to fill up with books, but reading them is even cooler.   The app Lets the user build reading lists, and self-authorize buying more based on actual reading progress.
